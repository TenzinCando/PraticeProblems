# Problem
Write code that will perform division without using any multiplication, division and mod operator.

# Assumptions:
- Both dividend and divisor will be 32-bit signed integers.
- The divisor will never be 0.
- Your function returns 2^31 âˆ’ 1 when the division result overflows.

# Example
Input: 	dividend = 10, divisor = 3
Output: 3

Input: 	dividend = 7, divisor = -3
Output: -2
